# Travel Journal

## About this project

This project is part of the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) React course, which I am taking to refresh my knowledge in React.

It consisted of creating a travel journal, with iconic places that I liked to visit.

In this project I have applied basic React concepts, such as creating components, using props, conditional rendering and using the map() method to render the same component for each element of an array.

It was quite simple but useful to recover basic but very important concepts to master this technology.
